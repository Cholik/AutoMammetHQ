# AutoMammet (HQ)
_**This plugin is very likely forbidden by the TOS, do not use!**_

AutoMammet (HQ) calculates the optimal schedule for the next cycle of your Island Sanctuary workshops, without the need for any spreadsheets.

Use the `/mammethq` command to bring up the AutoMammet HQ window. Click on the button 'Get schedule for tomorrow' to get tomorrows schedule. That's all there is to it.

This can be used by installing [XIVLauncher](https://github.com/goatcorp/FFXIVQuickLauncher) and using the Dalamud plugin system. The plugin must be added as a Dev Plugin.

Based on the [AutoMammet](https://github.com/Rietty/AutoMammet.git) plugin by Rietty.
